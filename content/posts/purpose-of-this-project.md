Portuguese institutions collect a wide array of data that can be used for research purposes. The most important institutions leading this effort are undoubtedly Statistics Portugal (INE) and Banco de Portugal but there many other data owners and data producers, mostly belonging to the public administration, that are also willing to share their data with researchers. The type of data that is available ranges from simple data collections to very rich and detailed census-like administrative micro data sets that can be assembled into very long panels.

The main goal of this blog is to make known to readers all data sources that researchers have at their disposal for empirical studies about the Portuguese reality. Additionally, I will also use these posts to discuss an extended set of tools used for efficient data treatment and research replicability.
