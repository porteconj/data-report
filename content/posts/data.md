[Nuno Palma](https://sites.google.com/site/npgpalma/home) and [Jaime Reis](https://www.ics.ulisboa.pt/en/pessoa/jaime-reis) constructed a data set on Portugal’s per capita GDP for the period 1527–1850. The authors discuss the data in their 2019 JEH paper and made it available [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=17M1nrjx-6B7fIMJGNTJ6tle6TtWNkLA7). We encourage other authors to let us know the data they can share with the research community. We are willing to announce it.
